**MANIAC** stands for **M**y **A**ttempt of the **N**aturally **I**nteresting **A**dvent of **C**ode

## About

As described by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code),

> [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar).

This repo contains MY version of solutions to the problems from various annual editions of Advent of Code. The solutions are written entirely in **Java**. All solutions in the repo are free to use and learn from.

## Tech

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) - Written in Javaâ„¢ SE Development Kit 11.0.9 (JDK 11.0.9)

- [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) - Text editor for Java

## Usage

1. Open the year-based directory of your choice.
2. Open the day-based sub-directory of your choice.
3. Inside the `src` directory, you'll be able to find the solution file - `Solution.java` and an input file - `input.txt`.
4. Some problems may contain a modified version of `input.txt` - `inputModified.txt`, that has been used instead for ease of processing the input data.

**Note:**

- Solutions in this repo might not always be the fastest or most efficient in terms of space usage.
- My solution to any of the included problems is just one way of solving the problem and is not the only right way to solve it.
- You might find likeness between the solutions in this repo and other openly available solutions on the internet. This could be a result of me taking inspiration/help from similar solutions or just sheer coincidence.
